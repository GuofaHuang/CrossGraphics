# CrossGraphics Clock Sample

This sample shows an animated clock running on a variety of platforms.

The clock code is contained in [Clock.cs](https://github.com/praeclarum/CrossGraphics/blob/master/samples/Clock/Clock/Clock.cs) and is just a very simple rendering of an analog clock (see screenshots below).
